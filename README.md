# Language Detection Text Classifier
This is a Google Colab Jupyter Notebook where I explored different text classification techniques in order to train a model that can predict the language of a text sample it is prompted with. </br>
All the different classifiers are trained, evaluated and tested on this publicly available [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/basilb2s/language-detection?resource=download)
